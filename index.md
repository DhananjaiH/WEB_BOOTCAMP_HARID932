##### Wikipedia's Article page

I chose Wikipedia, since it has been a staple of the internet since it's inception, and because I almost always have one tab open from this site.

Wiki's article views have a structurally simple and linear layout - a title and abstract containing summary information on the subject matter of the page. A throwback to web 1.0 style guides, its pages make heavy use of hyperlinks to other related articles on the Wiki sitemap.

Reference diagrams and animations are displayed on a separate section on the right of the page.

##### Yelp's home page

simple, intent-driven layout
users usually show up looking for food/restaurants - it is easy to jump right into the main action of the user without scrolling around much

##### Duck Duck Go's home page

despite being a donor-funded small search engine website, they stay true to their brand and focus on their service-search, keeping their branding content below, only for those who want to scroll and find out more.

##### IKEA's home & search results page
